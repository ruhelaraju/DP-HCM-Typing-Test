A high-voltage standoff between the police teams of Delhi and Shimla came to an end after a dramatic 24 hours on Thursday (February 26, 2026) morning, after the Delhi Police team was finally cleared to head back to the national capital along with the three Youth Congress activists arrested in connection with the “shirtless protest” at the AI Summit. In the 24-hour stalemate, the Delhi Police team was “detained” for about five hours even after procuring the transit remand from the ACJM. On Wednesday (February 25, 2026), the Himachal Pradesh Police registered a kidnapping case against the Delhi Police personnel and "detained" their vehicles at the Shogi border near Shimla. This occurred while they were en route to the national capital with the three Youth Congress members in custody.The three accused, along with the members of the Delhi Police, were taken to the residence of ACJM II Ekansh Kapil at 1.30 a.m. after undergoing medical examinations at the Deendyal Upadhyay Zonal Hospital in Shimla late Wednesday (February 25, 2026) night. Afterwards, they resumed their journey. However, early Thursday (February 26, 2026) morning, the Delhi Police team was detained again at Kanlog. The police team was instructed to return to the national capital with the accused, along with a few additional police personnel, while the remaining members were asked to to stay behind and cooperate with the investigation into the kidnapping case against them. The Shimla police also asked the Delhi team to hand over the copy of the digital evidence they possessed, which had allegedly been gathered when they picked up the activists in Rohru.
